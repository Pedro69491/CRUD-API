# CRUD-API
Development of a server with several APIs which connect with the Database.
For this project I've used Express.js, node.js and sqlite - (firstly to create my database tables and then to used sqlite syntax in the interactions between database and api's)
In order to complete this project I've passed by 70 individual pre-established tests (Mocha) which analyzed the reliability of the api's requests.
