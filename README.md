# CRUD-API
Development of a server with several APIs which connect to the Database.

For this project I've used stack such as: express.js, node.js and sqlite - (to create database tables and then to interact between database and api's)

In order to complete this project I've passed by 70 individual pre-established tests (Mocha) which analyzed the reliability of the api's requests.
